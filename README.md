# Todolist
Easily organize and prioritize your tasks and projects so you’ll always know exactly what to work on next.

Todolist is a small [Tiddlywiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/) plugin, contain all of the tasks that you need to complete on a given day. Todolist gives you the confidence that everything’s organized and accounted for, so you can make progress on the things that are important to you.

You can also make to-dos for major tasks like a project, a work assignment or an overall goal. Therefore, the overall purpose of creating a to-do is to remember tasks and prioritize them.
